Cooking With Mageon Game Manual
---------------------------------
ICS4UO Culminating Project. A game made to teach children how to plan and cook nutritious meals.

GAME OVERVIEW
---------------
Cooking With MAGEON is an educational and entertaining game made for children ages 10-14 to learn how to cook. Specifically, MAGEON guides the player in making meals, going through the necessary processes of shopping, organizing, and cooking. In the end, the player is judged on the metrics of how caloric, nutritious, and satisfactory their meals are.


GAME JUSTIFICATION
--------------------
We made this game to educate people on the complexities of making meals, from planning and shopping to organizing and cooking. More than 50% of Canadians aged 12 and up consume fruits and vegetables less than five times per day (Canada). While a main source of nutrients, many Canadians do not meet this measure of "healthy eating." Combined with issues such as inflation increasing prices of food by 10% during the pandemic, eating well has never been more difficult (Fradella). The game gives the player a sense of the issue, giving the player the experience of the sometimes fun and sometimes monotony of feeding oneself everyday. 


GAME INSTRUCTIONS 
------------------
Cooking With MAGEON is played with a keyboard and mouse/trackpad. The keys used are the arrow keys and the WASD keys. 
The main program file is called CookWithMageon.java.

LEVEL 1 
In Level 1, MAGEON introduces the player to the game. The key is used to continue dialogue and the mouse is used to interact with the fridge.

LEVEL 2 
In Level 2, the player goes grocery shopping in a maze. Either the arrow keys and the WASD keys can be used to move around the maze. The mouse is used to click on buttons confirming purchases of food in the grocery store maze.

LEVEL 3 
In Level 3, the player makes meals using the food that they just purchased. Either the arrow keys and the WASD keys can be used to move around the maze. To move in the kitchen, one can go left and right. To access the cabinet or the stove, one presses the UP or W key when in front of the thing you want to access. To exit from the stove or cabinet zoom-ins back to the kitchen, one presses the DOWN or S key.


COMMON PROBLEMS
------------------
- There is no option to EXIT the game in the middle of playing. The player's only option is go through with the entire game, because like in real life, the player is required to feed themself to survive (or click close on the window bar.)

LEVEL 2
- Inventory only shows when on a tile with a food item if you've just bought the item

LEVEL 3
- In MAGEON's dialogue, the previous dialogue message will appear underneath the current one.
